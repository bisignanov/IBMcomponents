            dependencies to latest'
          PR_BODY: |
            This PR was automatically generated to update Carbon versions and
            other package dependencies on a regular basis. This is not intended
            to create any breaking changes, and will be reflected as a minor
            version bump for affected packages. NB we'll run all tests and do
            visual verifications, but there is always the opportunity for
            unexpected regressions. If you're using one of the packages in a
            stable or production context you may want to check this before
            taking the next minor version, and do let us know ASAP if you see
            anything problematic.

            The goal is to update to the latest Carbon versions each Wednesday,
            to ensure we remain up-to-date with the latest changes and to
            ensure interoperability with other packages that also depend on
            Carbon. We will normally update all other dependencies at the same
            time to their latest versions, except for specific cases where we
            have found the updates to be problematic or require further work
            before they can be used. By using the latest stable version of each
            dependency we ensure we get fixes and improvements in a timely
            fashion and reduce the impact of updating the versions that can
            arise if versions are allowed to become stale for an extended
            period.

            #### What did you change?

            This action ran `yarn upgrade:automatic` to upgrade all
            carbon-related packages to the latest versions and to upgrade
            most other packages to the latest version, though certain critical
            packages are intentionally excluded.

            This action also deleted the `yarn.lock` file in order to recreate
            it with the latest matching versions of secondary dependencies.

            This PR includes the various `package.json` that pull our
            dependencies forward to the latest versions, the `yarn.lock` update
            that maps required versions to the actual versions to be used, and
            updates the offline mirror.

            #### How did you test and verify your work?

            This PR should not be merged until the following checks have been made:
            [ ] `yarn ci-check` runs cleanly and all tests pass (done
            automatically as part of the PR checks).
            [ ] the Netlify deploy-preview has been used to ensure that
            storybook runs and the main published components render correctly.
