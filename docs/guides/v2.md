# Carbon for IBM Products: v2 migration guide

This document will review in detail the changes in Carbon for IBM Products v1 to
v2. Because Carbon for IBM Products v2 uses Carbon v11, which utilizes Sass
modules, there is a requirement for teams to use the
[Dart Sass package](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) (`sass`), as opposed to
`node-sass`. This introduces some new sass concepts such as
[`@use`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use) vs
[`@import`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/import) and
[namespaces](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use#choosing-a-namespace).
For Carbon v11 migration guidance, see their
[migration guide](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/migration/v11.md).

v1 and v2 will both receive weekly releases occurring every Tuesday morning.
