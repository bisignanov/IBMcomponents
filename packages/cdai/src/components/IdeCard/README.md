# IDECard Component

## Purpose

To provide a single card component which can be used separately from IdeHome
which provides a more complex logic for the landing page of a product.

### Carbon elements used

- type tokens for fonts
- grid - designed for 16 (default is 12, despite what the documentation says)
  columns. To enable this, add the below to your root scss file:

```
$feature-flags: (
  grid-columns-16: true
);
```

- theme - designed using `carbon--theme--white`. Variables are set up to work
  with any other carbon/custom theme, as long as the carbon color variables are
  used

### Component details

The cards can be rendered in 2 ways:

- providing the mandatory props which will style the card according to the
  component styling sheet
- providing `cardType: custom` and
  `cardContent: () => {<custom render function>}`
