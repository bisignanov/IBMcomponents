# IdeFilter Component

## Purpose

To provide a consistent filter and search UX. The UX brings together the concept
of filtering (a set of known, orthogonal categories, with various things within
those categories), and plain-text search.

As the user types into the input, the list of options filters appropriately,
highlighting the most appropriate match. If the user hits enter, the highlighted
match is added as a tag in the input. If the match is an option, it will be
rendered and removed from the list of options. If it isn't an option, it will be
treated as a plain-text search.

### Carbon elements used

- Tags
- Colour tokens
- Icons

### Non-carbon elements used

- [react-select](https://react-select.com)

### Component properties

- options: a set of options, sorted into categories. Each category has a label
  and a set of options. Each option has a label and a value, and optionally a
  `type` - this `type` is a Carbon 10 tag type - which in the latest
  documentation consists of "red" | "magenta" | "purple" | "blue" | "cyan" |
  "teal" | "green" | "gray" | "cool-gray" | "warm-gray". Defaults to "gray".
  Each option may have additional properties - they will be ignored but retained
  by the component.

```json
[
  {
    "label": "Languages",
    "options": [
      { "type": "blue", "value": "en", "label": "English" },
      { "type": "blue", "value": "fr", "label": "French" }
    ]
  },
  {
    "label": "Sizes",
    "options": [
      { "type": "green", "value": "s", "label": "Small" },
      { "type": "green", "value": "m", "label": "Medium" },
      { "type": "green", "value": "l", "label": "Large" }
    ]
  }
]
```

- placeholderText: a string to be rendered as placeholder text in the input.
- onChange: a handler function for change events. It should take a single
  parameter which is the new value of the input. The value will be an array.
  Each element of the array will either be one of the options defined in the
  options property, or it will be of the following format, and show be treated
  as a plain-text search (with whatever semantics make sense in your use-case):

```json
{
  "label": "<user-entered-text>",
  "value": "<user-entered-text>",
  "__plaintext__": true
}
```
