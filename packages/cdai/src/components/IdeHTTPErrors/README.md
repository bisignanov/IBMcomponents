## Component details

The component will render without any user-defined props, but it is recommended
to provide at least the `title` and `description` props (they default to
`CHANGE ME` if not defined).

### `background`: number

The background image to use when rendering the component. If defined, must be
403 or 404. If undefined, a generic background image is used.

Custom backgrounds are NOT supported.

### `title`: string

The text to render in the title section. Defaults to 'CHANGE ME' if undefined.
Typically a pre-translated string similar to `Error 403`. See
https://pages.github.ibm.com/ide-design-guidelines/ide-design-guidelines-v2/patterns/http-errors/usage
for recommended conventions.

Throws an error if a non-string value is provided.

### `description`: string

The text to render in the description section. Defaults to 'CHANGE ME' if
undefined. See
https://pages.github.ibm.com/ide-design-guidelines/ide-design-guidelines-v2/patterns/http-errors/usage
for recommended conventions.

Throws an error if a non-string value is provided.

### `details`: string

The text to render in the details section. Does not render if undefined. See
https://pages.github.ibm.com/ide-design-guidelines/ide-design-guidelines-v2/patterns/http-errors/usage
for recommended conventions.

Throws an error if a non-string value is provided.

### `links`: {text: String, url: String} | [{text: String, url: String}, ...]

The hyperlink(s) to render in the links section. Does not render if undefined. A
link object or array of link objects is expected. For example:

Defined as an object:

```
<IdeHTTPError
  links={{
    text: 'Custom text', // What you want the user to see when the link is rendered
    url: 'http://custom-location', // Where you want the user to be redirected to when they click the link
  }}
/>
```

Defined as an array:

```
<IdeHTTPError
  links={[
    {
      text: 'Custom text 1',
      url: 'http://custom-location-1',
    },
    {
      text: 'Custom text 2',
      url: 'http://custom-location-2',
    },
  ]}
/>
```

Throws an error if a non-object or a non-array value is provided. Throws an
error if the `text` or `url` props in the link object definitions are defined
with non-String values.
