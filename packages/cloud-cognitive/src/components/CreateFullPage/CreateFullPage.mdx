## Example usage

There are **3** components that make up a Create Full Page component, which can
be used in unison to create the desired look, or flow. Please note, to utilize
the Create Full Page component, you'll need to have a minimum of two steps. If
you are looking for a one step creation flow, consider Create Tearsheet, Create
Side Panel, or Create Modal.

#### Simple Create Full Page

This is used when you have one section per step, and no need for the toggle
view. This can be created by passing in the overall `<CreateFullPage />`
component and the `<CreateFullPageStep />` component as shown below:

```
    <CreateFullPage {...args}>
      <CreateFullPageStep
        title: 'Partition',
        subtitle: 'This is the unique name used to recognize your topic.',
        description: 'It will also be used by your producers and consumers as part of the connection information.'>
        <TextInput
          id="test-1"
          invalidText="A valid value is required"
          labelText="Topic name"
          placeholder="Enter topic name"
        />
      </CreateFullPageStep>
      <CreateFullPageStep
        title="Core configuration"
        description="We recommend you fill out and evaluate these details at a minimum before deploying your topic.">
        <NumberInput
          id="test-2"
          invalidText="Number is not valid"
          label="Number input label"
          max={100}
          min={0}
          step={10}
          value={50}
        />
      </CreateFullPageStep>
    </CreateFullPage>
```

Note that in order for this to render correctly with the preferred styling, a
`title` prop _must_ be supplied to the `<CreateFullPageStep />` component.

#### Simple Create Full Page with sections

This is used when you have multiple sections in each respective step and no need
for the toggle view. This can be accomplished by passing in a title and
description to the step, along with the form items. For each additional section,
you may include the separate component, `<CreateFullPageSection />`.

```
      ...
      <CreateFullPageStep
        title="Core configuration"
        description="We recommend you fill out and evaluate these details at a minimum before deploying your topic.">
        <TextInput
          id="test1"
          invalidText="A valid value is required"
          labelText="Topic name"
          placeholder="Enter topic name"
        />
        <CreateFullPageSection
          id="1"
          title="Partition"
          description="We recommend you fill out and evaluate these details at a minimum before deploying your topic.">
          <TextInput
            id="test-1"
            invalidText="A valid value is required"
            labelText="Topic name"
            placeholder="Enter topic name"
          />
        </CreateFullPageSection>
        <CreateFullPageSection
          id="2"
          title="Partition 2"
          description="We recommend you fill out and evaluate these details at a minimum before deploying your topic.">
          <TextInput
            id="test-2"
            invalidText="A valid value is required"
            labelText="Topic name"
            placeholder="Enter topic name"
          />
        </CreateFullPageSection>
      </CreateFullPageStep>
```

Note that in order to have these items render correctly, your first "section"
_must_ be utilizing the `title` and optional `description` props of
`CreateFullPageStep` component. Each additional section after this will be
wrapped in their own `CreateFullPageSection` component.

#### Create Full Page with Toggle View

The usage of this optional toggle will display all content, including content
that may not have otherwise been seen, in a different view. The toggle triggers
the `<ProgressIndicator />` component in the left side influence to switch to a
`<SideNav />` and all content to display in a list format in the main content
area. The setup for this varies slightly from the two simple examples provided
above.

In order to utilize both toggle views, all `CreateFullPageStep` components must
_only_ have `CreateFullPageSection`s as children. Adding a `title` or
`description` prop to `CreateFullPageStep` will have some unintended behavior.
To solve this, our code would look like this:

```
      ...
      <CreateFullPageStep>
        <CreateFullPageSection
          id="1"
          title="Partition"
          description="We recommend you fill out and evaluate these details at a minimum before deploying your topic.">
          <TextInput
            id="test-1"
            invalidText="A valid value is required"
            labelText="Topic name"
            placeholder="Enter topic name"
          />
        </CreateFullPageSection>
        <CreateFullPageSection
          id="2"
          title="Partition 2"
          description="We recommend you fill out and evaluate these details at a minimum before deploying your topic.">
          <TextInput
            id="test-1"
            invalidText="A valid value is required"
            labelText="Topic name"
            placeholder="Enter topic name"
          />
        </CreateFullPageSection>
        <CreateFullPageSection
          id="3"
          title="Partition 3"
          description="We recommend you fill out and evaluate these details at a minimum before deploying your topic.">
          <TextInput
            id="test-2"
            invalidText="A valid value is required"
            labelText="Topic name"
            placeholder="Enter topic name"
          />
        </CreateFullPageSection>
      </CreateFullPageStep>
```

Note that each `section` has their own unique ID. This is important, because it
will tell our left navigation exactly where to scroll to upon click. We can also add some additional props in our section which would allow it to only be shown when the toggle is switched to 'on':

```

```

<Canvas>
  <Story id={getStorybookSlug(pkg, CreateFullPage.displayName, 'boxed-set')} />
</Canvas>
