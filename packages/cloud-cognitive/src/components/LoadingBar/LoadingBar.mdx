## Overview

The LoadingBar component provides a way to communicate the loading state to
users. It is intended to fill the space of where it's used, and should persist
until the loading action is complete. Once complete, the active prop may be set
to false to hide the LoadingBar. The LoadingBar has two modes of operation:
Indeterminate and Determinate. If no percentage is provided to the component,
the LoadingBar behaves in indeterminate mode, with the bar moving from side to
side, to indicate loading in progress. If a percentage prop is provided, the
determinate mode of operation is used and the loading bar fills until the
specified percentage to indicate current progress to the user.
