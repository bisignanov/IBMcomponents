## Overview

The `AboutModal` modal component provides a way to communicate product
information to users and sits on top of an applications’ main window.

The `AboutModal` is triggered by a user’s action which appears on top of the
main page content, and is persistent until dismissed. The purpose of this modal
should be immediately apparent to the user, with a clear and obvious path to
completion.
