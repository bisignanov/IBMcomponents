# Carbon for IBM Products Community

## About

The Community package has two primary goals in mind: to host experimental
components / patterns and to enable teams to share code that may not be
officially supported or documented through the design system guild.

Traditionally, components and patterns are defined by design, approved via DSAG,
developed by the C4P team, and then added to the core library. The Community
package represents a different approach to this system. If a product team or
developer believes they have organically developed a new pattern or noticed a
recurring design that hasn't been defined as an official pattern and wants to
share it with the larger Carbon for IBM Products community, they can contribute
it for others to leverage even as the design use cases are being defined.

One of the biggest concerns with design-driven development is that there are
some limitations to the design process that are not immediately clear until it
reaches the development phase. Accessibility is one of the biggest concerns in
modern UI development. While design tools may allow for some accessibility
checks out of the box, such as color contrast or font size, some components and
patterns have far more complex accessibility concerns that a designer may not be
able to take into account. Issues with focus and keyboard navigation do not
become noticeable until you can interact with code in the browser. By allowing
development to happen in tandem with design, these limitations are discovered
far more quickly in the design cycle and can be fixed much more quickly. The
Community package can act as a prototyping environment where development and
design can work together simultaneously to improve these kinds of UX concerns.
