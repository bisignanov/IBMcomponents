# Carbon for IBM Products Community

## About

The purpose of the Community package is to host experimental components and
patterns.

Traditionally, components and patterns are defined by design, approved via DSAG,
developed by the C4P team, and then added to the core library. The Community
Package represents a different approach to this system. If a product team or
developer believes they have organically developed something that could or
should be a pattern and wants to share it with the larger Carbon community,.

One of the biggest concerns with design-driven development is that there are
some limitations to design that are not immediately clear until it reaches the
development phase. Accessibility is one of the biggest concerns in modern UI
development. While design tools may allow for some accessibility checks out of
the box, such as color contrast or font size, some components and patterns have
far more complex accessibility concerns that a designer may not be able to take
into account. Issues with focus and keyboard navigation do not become noticeable
until you can interact with code in the browser. By allowing development to
happen in tandem with design, these limitations are discovered far more quickly
in the design cycle and can be fixed much more quickly. The Community package
can act as a prototyping environment where development and design can work
together simultaneously to improve these kinds of UX concerns.
