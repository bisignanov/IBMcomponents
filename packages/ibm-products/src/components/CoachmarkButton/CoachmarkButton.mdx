## Overview

[Coachmark Buttons](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/novice-to-pro/components/coachmark/usage/#floating)
are used with the floating variant of the Coachmark. As such, the props outlined
below are only the props for this component, but will accept any of the
[Carbon buttons](https://v10.carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage/)
props.

Coachmark buttons are always used within the `target` prop of the Coachmark
component. The target prop of the Coachmark should always be either a
CoachmarkBeacon or a CoachmarkButton.
