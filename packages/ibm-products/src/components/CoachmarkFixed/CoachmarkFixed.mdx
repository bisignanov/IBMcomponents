## Overview

[CoachmarkFixed](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/novice-to-pro/components/coachmark/usage/#fixed)
appears fixed at the bottom right corner of the browser window with page load.
It starts in a minimized state to cover as little of the UI as possible (in
tests, when shown expanded by default, users immediately closed them without
reading to get them out of their way). When dismissed, it slides down off the
page.

_[Novice to pro](https://pages.github.ibm.com/security/security-design/teams-across-security/novice-to-pro/overview/)
is a continuous learning methodology + framework aimed to orient, onboard,
explain, educate, and cultivate novice users into high-functioning power users._

## Note on theming

The CoachmarkFixed utilizes the theme prop (E.g. `theme='dark'`) to set the
appropriate background and font colors for the overlay. Specify a value ('light'
or 'dark') to display properly within your usage.
