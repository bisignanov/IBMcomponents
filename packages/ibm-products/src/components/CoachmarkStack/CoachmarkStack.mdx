## Overview

<!-- TODO: Overview. -->

[CoachmarkStacked](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/novice-to-pro/components/coachmark/usage/#stacked)
appears fixed at the bottom right corner of the browser window with page load.
It starts in a minimized state to cover as little of the UI as possible (in
tests, when shown expanded by default, users immediately closed them without
reading to get them out of their way). It can include ghost buttons to trigger
another layer to slide up to stack on top of it, much like the
[Stacked Tearsheet](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/components/tearsheet/usage/#navigation).
When dismissed, the stacked layer exits by sliding back down, revealing the main
layer. When the main layer is dismissed, it slides down off the page. Only one
layer can be stacked on the main layer.

_[Novice to pro](https://pages.github.ibm.com/security/security-design/teams-across-security/novice-to-pro/overview/)
is a continuous learning methodology + framework aimed to orient, onboard,
explain, educate, and cultivate novice users into high-functioning power users._

## Note on theming

The CoachmarkStacked utilizes the theme prop (E.g. `theme='dark'`) to set the
appropriate background and font colors for the child Coachmark elements. Specify
a value ('light' or 'dark') to display properly within your usage.
