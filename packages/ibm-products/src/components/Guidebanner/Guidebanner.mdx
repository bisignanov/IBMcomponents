## Overview

[Guide banners](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/novice-to-pro/components/guide-banner/usage/)
are used to give a bird’s-eye view of information users need to know before
diving into the page’s workflow. Guide banners sit at the top of a page or
larger section of content. They orient users on their first time accessing a
page, or after significant page updates, and are used to introduce related
foundational concepts.

## About Novice to pro

[Novice to pro](https://pages.github.ibm.com/security/security-design/teams-across-security/novice-to-pro/overview/)
is a continuous learning methodology and framework that aims to orient, onboard,
explain, educate, and cultivate novice users into high-functioning power users.

## Note on theming

The Guidebanner is theme agnostic; it is always white text on a graduated
background. If you intend on using a theme-enabled component as part of the
content—such as a link or button—be sure to specify `theme='dark'` with your
component, so that it shows up correctly against the dark background.

## Example usage

### Collapsible

This is the typical use case. The Guidebanner is minimized until the user opts
to expand it by clicking the "Read more" button.

Set the Guidebanner's `collapsible` prop to true.
