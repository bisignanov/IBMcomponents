## Overview

The
[non-linear reading](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/novice-to-pro/components/nonlinear-reading/usage/)
component provides a way to explain concepts more broadly and succinctly while
allowing users to read more detail as needed without leaving their context.

Use non-linear reading when space is limited to share a brief, at-a-glance,
summary of a concept that may require more explanation for some users. You can
also use this component when the level of detail or the amount of context needed
on a topic will vary across users and you donâ€™t want to over-explain to more
mature users. Non-linear reading is helpful to provide context for the first
time a user engages with the product as well as for introducing new concepts
later on as they get more familiar with base-level functionality.

_[Novice to pro](https://pages.github.ibm.com/security/security-design/teams-across-security/novice-to-pro/overview/)
is a continuous learning methodology + framework aimed to orient, onboard,
explain, educate, and cultivate novice users into high-functioning power users._

## Example usage

### Single Level

All you need for the basics.

<Canvas>
  <Story id={getStoryId(NonLinearReading.displayName, 'single-level')} />
</Canvas>

### Multiple Level

Multiple, embedded non-linear reading components can be used in the same text
block.

<Canvas>
  <Story id={getStoryId(NonLinearReading.displayName, 'multiple-level')} />
</Canvas>

### With Gradient Background

Some other Novice to pro components use a gradient background as shown.

If using NonLinearReading inside one of these components, always use
`theme="dark"`.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    id={getStoryId(NonLinearReading.displayName, 'with-gradient-background')}
  />
</Canvas>
